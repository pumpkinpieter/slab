  abstract = {We present an exact simplified method for the power normalization of the radiation modes in planar multilayer or graded index structures. The method depends mainly on the physical understanding of the radiation mode as a superposition of plane waves. The technique proposed simplifies greatly the required calculations and gives exactly the same analytical results obtained by the classical integration technique. Beside its physical point of view, this technique could be integrated in a more general computer program for the analysis of integrated optical discontinuities.},

The locations of these minima are found to be largely unaffected by the relative position of the inclusions.

  abstract = {Leaky waves have been among the most active areas of research in microwave engineering over the second half of the 20th century. They have been shown to dominate the near-field of several open wave-guiding structures, of great interest to tailor their radiation, guidance and filtering properties. The elegant theoretical analyses and deep physical insights in this area, developed in an era in which computational resources were limited, represent a fundamental scientific legacy that is still extremely relevant in today's engineering society and beyond. In this regard, the relevance of leaky-wave concepts has been increasingly recognized in recent times over a broader scientific community, including optics and physics societies. In this paper, after revisiting the fundamental concepts of leaky-wave theory, we discuss and connect different relevant research activities in which leaky-wave concepts have been applied, with the goal of facilitating multidisciplinary interactions on these topics. In addition to the canonical microwave applications of leaky waves, particular attention is devoted to a few areas of interest in modern optics, such as directive optical antennas, extraordinary optical transmission, and embedded scattering eigenvalues, in which leaky waves play a fundamental role.},

In this chapter, we concentrate on "powerful" nonlinear situations, when light guides itself in a homogenous medium without any intervening core-cladding structure. In other words, light itself induces its own guiding structure. This fascinating phenomena has been studied theoretically with many confirming experiments. Light guiding light offers a multitude of devices wherein light becomes the master of its own destiny and allows for the possibility of rewritable circuitry.  There are various approaches for describing highly nonlinear phenomena like self-induced waveguides. One is formal and lacks intuition. This approach is to solve Maxwell's equations from the outset with an intensity-dependent refractive index, completely ignoring the physics of the earlier chapters. The other approach is to build on our earlier chapters, by recognising that a light indued waveguide is a waveguide just like those we have already studied; the only difference being that its refractive index (and hence its V value) is now dependent on the intensity of light.},

Our results illustrate that one can obtain disparate mode confinement loss profiles for the same optical fiber design simply by moving the boundary to a new material region. We conclude with new recommendations for how to better model these losses.},
